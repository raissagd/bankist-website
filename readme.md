This project was coded along the "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" course, by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. This is as marketing website for a bank app (which, by the way, has also already been done, and you can check it [here](https://github.com/raissagd/bankist-app)), featuring a bunch of awesome functionalities using only JavaScript!

## You can access the full deployed app [here](https://raissagd.github.io/bankist-website/)!
